## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are particularly effective for sequential data. This project demonstrates the basics of RNNs and how they can be used for tasks such as time series prediction, text generation, and more.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation of RNN
- Examples of sentiment analysis
- Well-documented code with comments
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KratikMehta/IMDB-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Simple-RNN.git
cd IMDB-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Simple-RNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explore the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` directory to understand how RNNs work and how to use them for different tasks. You can run the notebooks using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
